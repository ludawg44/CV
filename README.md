# Webpage

Welcome to my GitHub's webpage repository. When I left Ernst & Young as a consultant to update my skillset in business analytics, I thought I'd learn the latest trends and techniques. I couldn't imagine that I'd continue my pursuit of understanding how data is extracted, analyzed and visualized. 

Since then I've been working on projects that I want to share with others. I hope you enjoy the website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
